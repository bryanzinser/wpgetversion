Checks to see if your site is running the most up to date version of wordpress.

This likes to break very easily.

Example: python wpgetversion.py -w routescribe.com 3fives.com

Example with email: python wpgetversion.py -e FROM@example.com TO@example.com -w routescribe.com 3fives.com
This will not send an email if all sites are up to date.
